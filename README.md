# Cpp-Minesweeper

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of the command line interface as a GUI in a C++ application. Components of [a previous project](https://github.com/jlinehan-01/Java-Minesweeper) will be used to implement this. This project was made for bash and run on Ubuntu; as some of the code to get this to work in the terminal are os-specific it may not work on some platforms. The game essentially works by continuously printing over keyboard output to give the illusion of a GUI.

## Usage
* Compile with make
* Use ./mines <width> <height> <mines> to run
* Use arrow keys to move the cursor
* Use any letter key to open a tile
